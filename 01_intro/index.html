<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
Here are at most 3 ideas for my final project
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1 : DJ Gloves </h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

My initial idea was to make somet type of musical instrument glove. I was inspired by
Imogen Heap's MiMu gloves which track body movement to play, loop, pause, and change sounds. However,
I don't want to do something that derivative, so I thought of maybe making a glove that reacts to when you 
drum with your hands. So tapping on a table would play different snares and basses for each finger.

<h4>Idea 2: Haptic glove (video-tracking version of last idea)</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

My second idea would to do something more like the MiMu glove, using video tracking through a software like 
Touch Designer to track movements in the body to react and create sounds. Specific movements would be recorded and 
  identified by their path which would trigger a specific sound or sound-editing process to occur. This would be very
  coding heavy though and I joined this class to do something more hands-on.

<h4>Idea 3: Electric Skateboard</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>
I've been skateboarding since I was eight and have always wanted to try one of the electric skateboards. I think the idea
itself is pretty boring as its been done so many times so I would definitely have to add other features.
